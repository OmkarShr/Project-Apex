- **Composition**: Engine composed of specialized processors and aggregators
- **Dependency Injection**: Services injected rather than hard-coded
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has focused, well-defined purpose
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Easy to add new optimization strategies or data sources

## 9. System Integration Points

The architecture supports integration with external systems through well-defined interfaces:
