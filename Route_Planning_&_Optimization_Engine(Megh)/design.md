# Route Planning & Optimization Engine Design (Revised)

## 1. Classes and Member Methods

### Class: `RoutePlanningEngine`

The main engine for planning and optimizing delivery routes.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `plan_route(vehicle_id, orders)` | Plans a new delivery route for a vehicle. |
| `optimize_route(route_id, optimizer)` | Optimizes an existing delivery route using a specific optimizer. |
| `get_route(route_id)` | Retrieves a delivery route. |
| `get_traffic_data(route)` | Gets real-time traffic data for a route. |
| `get_weather_forecast(route)` | Gets the weather forecast for a route. |

### Class: `Route`

Represents a delivery route for a vehicle.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(route_id, vehicle_id, stops)` | Initializes a new Route object. |
| `get_total_distance()` | Calculates the total distance of the route. |
| `get_estimated_time()` | Estimates the total time required for the route. |
| `add_stop(stop)` | Adds a stop to the route. |

### Class: `Stop`

Represents a single stop in a delivery route.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(stop_id, order_id, address, time_window)` | Initializes a new Stop object. |

### Class: `RouteOptimizer`

An abstract class for different route optimization algorithms.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `optimize(route)` | Optimizes the given route. |

### Class: `NearestNeighborOptimizer`

A concrete implementation of a route optimizer.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `optimize(route)` | Optimizes the route using the nearest neighbor algorithm. |

### Class: `GeneticAlgorithmOptimizer`

A concrete implementation of a route optimizer.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `optimize(route)` | Optimizes the route using a genetic algorithm. |

### Class: `TrafficService`

A service for getting real-time traffic data.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `get_traffic_for_route(route)` | Gets the real-time traffic conditions for a given route. |

### Class: `WeatherService`

A service for getting weather forecasts.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `get_forecast_for_route(route)` | Gets the weather forecast for a given route. |
