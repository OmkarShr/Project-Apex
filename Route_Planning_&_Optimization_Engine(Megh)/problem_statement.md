### 15. Route Planning & Optimization Engine
Design a computationally intensive engine dedicated to solving the complex "traveling salesman" problem for the delivery fleet, calculating the most efficient multi-stop routes to minimize costs and meet customer expectations. This module is the strategic brain of the last-mile delivery operation.[15] It will ingest a batch of confirmed shipments from the Order Management Service, each with a specific delivery address and potentially a required delivery time window. The engine must then consider a multitude of real-time and static variables, including live traffic conditions, weather forecasts, vehicle capacities (from the Fleet Management Service), driver shift times, and order priorities. Using advanced algorithms and heuristics, it will calculate and generate optimized route plans for each driver, sequencing the stops to reduce total travel distance and time. The output will be a detailed, turn-by-turn itinerary for each vehicle, which is then passed to the Real-Time Delivery Tracking & Driver Interface module for execution. This engine is critical for reducing fuel consumption, increasing the number of deliveries a driver can make per shift, and ensuring on-time delivery promises are met.
