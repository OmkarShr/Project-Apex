### 18. Analytics & Reporting Dashboard
Design a comprehensive business intelligence module to aggregate, analyze, and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) from across the entire smart warehouse and delivery ecosystem. This service acts as the central nervous system for managerial oversight and strategic decision-making. It will ingest operational data and events from all other modulesâ€”such as order processing times, inventory accuracy rates, picking efficiency, robot utilization, on-time delivery percentages, and fuel costs.[16, 1] The module will process and store this data in a data warehouse or analytics database optimized for complex queries. Its primary output will be a series of user-friendly, real-time dashboards tailored to different roles, such as a warehouse manager's view focusing on operational throughput or a logistics manager's view focusing on delivery costs and performance. In addition to live dashboards, it will provide capabilities for generating historical reports, identifying long-term trends, and pinpointing bottlenecks or areas for improvement. This data-driven insight is essential for continuous optimization of the entire operation.[17, 2]
