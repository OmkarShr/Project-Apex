### 19. Predictive Intelligence Engine (AI/ML)
Design an advanced analytics module that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to move beyond historical reporting and provide predictive, forward-looking insights. This service aims to make the entire operation more proactive rather than reactive. One of its primary functions will be demand forecasting; by analyzing historical sales data, seasonality, and market trends, it will predict future product demand with a high degree of accuracy.[4, 6] These forecasts will be fed to the Inventory Management Service to optimize stock levels, preventing both stockouts and costly overstocking. Another critical function is predictive maintenance. By analyzing operational data from robots and delivery vehicles (e.g., runtime hours, sensor readings, error rates), the engine will build models to predict when a piece of equipment is likely to fail. This allows the system to automatically schedule maintenance before a breakdown occurs, minimizing unplanned downtime and ensuring the continuous, smooth operation of both the warehouse and the delivery fleet.[16, 2]
