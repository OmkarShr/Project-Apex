## 1. Classes and Member Methods

### Class: `PredictiveIntelligenceEngine`

The main engine for predictive intelligence.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `forecast_demand(product_id, horizon)` | Forecasts the demand for a product. |
| `predict_maintenance(equipment_id)` | Predicts when a piece of equipment will need maintenance. |
| `train_model(model_type, data_source)` | Trains a machine learning model. |

### Class: `MLModel`

An abstract class for machine learning models.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `train(data)` | Trains the machine learning model. |
| `predict(input_data)` | Makes a prediction using the machine learning model. |
| `save(path)` | Saves the model to a file. |
| `load(path)` | Loads a model from a file. |

### Class: `DemandForecastingModel`

A concrete implementation for demand forecasting.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `train(sales_data)` | Trains the demand forecasting model. |
| `predict(product_id, horizon)` | Predicts the demand for a product. |

### Class: `PredictiveMaintenanceModel`

A concrete implementation for predictive maintenance.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `train(equipment_data)` | Trains the predictive maintenance model. |
| `predict(equipment_id)` | Predicts the next maintenance date for a piece of equipment. |

### Class: `ModelTrainer`

A class for training machine learning models.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `train(model, data_source)` | Trains a machine learning model with data from a data source. |

### Class: `Prediction`

Represents a prediction made by a model.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(prediction_id, model_id, input_data, output_data)` | Initializes a new Prediction object. |

### Class: `DataSource`

An abstract class for providing data to models.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `get_data()` | Gets data from the source. |

### Class: `SalesDataSource`

A concrete implementation for providing sales data.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `get_data()` | Gets historical sales data. |

### Class: `EquipmentDataSource`

A concrete implementation for providing equipment data.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `get_data()` | Gets operational data from equipment. |
