### 9. Master Robotics Control & Task Dispatcher
Design the central "brain" for the entire robotic fleet, acting as a master orchestration and dispatching service. This module abstracts the complexity of managing a heterogeneous collection of robots (AMRs, AS/RS, drones) by providing a single, unified interface for other systems to request automated tasks.[10, 11] Its primary responsibility is to receive high-level commands, such as "retrieve product SKU 123 from location A-14-2" from the Picking Engine or "audit aisle B" from the Inventory Service. It then translates these commands into specific instructions for the most suitable type of robot. The dispatcher must maintain a real-time registry of all available robots, tracking their current status (e.g., `Idle`, `Executing`, `Charging`), battery levels, and location within the warehouse. It will employ intelligent algorithms to prioritize tasks and assign them to the optimal robotic unit based on proximity, capability, and current workload, ensuring maximum utilization and efficiency of the automation hardware. This service is the critical command and control layer that decouples business logic from the low-level mechanics of robotic operation.[10, 4]
