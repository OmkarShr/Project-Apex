### 16. Real-Time Delivery Tracking & Driver Interface
Design the backend service that powers the driver's mobile application and provides real-time visibility into the entire delivery process for both internal dispatchers and external customers. This module is the operational nexus of the last-mile. Its first key function is to serve the optimized route plans from the Route Planning Engine to the drivers' mobile devices, presenting them with a clear list of stops, navigation guidance, and specific delivery instructions for each order.[12, 14] As drivers proceed along their routes, the mobile app will continuously transmit GPS coordinates back to this service, allowing it to maintain a live, map-based view of the entire fleet's location. This real-time data feed is crucial for dispatchers to monitor progress and manage exceptions. The service will also process status updates sent from the driver's app, such as `Delivery_Completed` or `Delivery_Failed`, which in turn updates the Order Management Service. Finally, it exposes a secure API that allows the Customer Notification Service to provide customers with accurate, up-to-the-minute tracking information and ETAs for their packages.
