### 5. Order Management Service
Design a central service to orchestrate the entire lifecycle of a customer order, from initial ingestion to final fulfillment confirmation. This module acts as the primary hub for all sales-related activities, responsible for receiving and validating orders from multiple channels, such as e-commerce websites, mobile apps, or enterprise ERP systems. Upon ingestion, it must perform a series of critical validations, including verifying customer details, checking for fraudulent activity, and, most importantly, communicating with the Inventory Management Service to confirm stock availability and place an atomic reservation on the required items to prevent overselling.[7] Once an order is confirmed and payment is authorized, this service becomes the master state machine, tracking the order's progress through subsequent stages: `Pending`, `Processing`, `Awaiting_Shipment`, `Shipped`, and `Delivered`. It is responsible for initiating downstream workflows by publishing events or sending commands to other modules, such as instructing the Picking & Packing Orchestration Engine to begin fulfillment and later notifying the Shipping & Manifest Service when a package is ready for dispatch. This module provides the unified, authoritative view of an order's status for both internal operators and the end customer.[8]
