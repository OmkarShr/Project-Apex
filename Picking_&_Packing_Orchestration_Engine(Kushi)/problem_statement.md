### 6. Picking & Packing Orchestration Engine
Design an intelligent engine responsible for translating confirmed customer orders into optimized, executable tasks for the warehouse floor. This module acts as the bridge between the digital order and the physical fulfillment process. Its primary function is to receive fulfillment requests from the Order Management Service and apply sophisticated logic to create the most efficient picking strategy. This involves implementing various algorithms, such as batch picking (grouping multiple orders with common items), zone picking (assigning pickers to specific areas), or wave picking (scheduling picks in timed waves) to minimize travel time and maximize throughput. The engine must be aware of the warehouse layout, real-time inventory locations (from Module 4), and the capabilities of available resources (both human operators and robots). It will generate and dispatch prioritized pick lists to workers' handheld devices or directly to the Master Robotics Control system. Concurrently, it will orchestrate the workflow at packing stations, providing packers with correct order details, specifying required packaging materials based on product data (from Module 2), and guiding them through the final verification and sealing process before the package is handed off for shipping.[3]
