### 6. Picking & Packing Orchestration Engine
In a Smart Warehouse, the Picking & Packing Orchestration Engine plays a critical role in ensuring that customer orders are processed, fulfilled, and dispatched efficiently. The primary responsibility of this engine is to coordinate between inventory data, picking robots, and packing stations so that every item is retrieved and packaged accurately. The engine is designed to receive an order request from the Order Management System and then analyze the required products. Based on real-time inventory information, it allocates tasks to the most suitable picking robots. 
These robots navigate the warehouse aisles, locate the required items, and transport them to the nearest packing station. At the packing station, the orchestration engine ensures that the correct items are sorted, scanned, and packaged according to the order specifications. The engine also handles special cases such as fragile goods, bulk orders, or time-sensitive deliveries, by prioritizing tasks and directing resources accordingly.
To optimize efficiency, the orchestration engine incorporates task scheduling algorithms that assign picking and packing jobs based on factors such as robot availability, item location, and packing station workload. This prevents bottlenecks and maximizes throughput. Additionally, the engine is capable of tracking the entire process in real time, thereby providing updates to the monitoring dashboard and alerting operators in case of errors or delays. 
A key feature of the design is its object-oriented structure. The engine can be broken down into core classes such as Order, Item, Robot, PackingStation, and TaskScheduler. Each class encapsulates relevant attributes and methods to perform its responsibilities. For example, the Robot class can execute functions like moveToLocation(), pickItem(), and deliverToStation(), while the TaskScheduler class can assignTasks() and balanceLoad().
