# ðŸ“¦ Picking & Packing Orchestration Engine Design (Final)

## 1. Core Orchestration Classes

### Class: `OrchestrationEngine`
The central coordinator that manages the entire picking and packing workflow â€” from receiving orders to assigning robots and packing stations.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `processOrder(order)` | Initiates processing for an incoming order. |
| `allocateRobot(item)` | Selects and assigns an appropriate robot for a specific item. |
| `assignPacking(station)` | Assigns an order or package to a packing station. |
| `logEvent(event_message)` | Sends an event message to the system logger. |

---

### Class: `TaskScheduler`
Handles order prioritization, batch scheduling, and efficient distribution of tasks.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `assignTasks(order)` | Breaks down an order into smaller picking/packing tasks. |
| `prioritizeOrders()` | Determines the order execution sequence based on urgency and location. |
| `rescheduleTask(task_id)` | Reallocates or retries a failed task. |

---

### Class: `Logger`
Responsible for recording activities, tracking errors, and generating performance reports.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `recordEvent(message)` | Logs events or updates from the orchestration process. |
| `generateReport()` | Produces performance or error reports for analysis. |

---

## 2. Robot Abstractions

### Abstract Class: `AbstractRobot`
A generic robot blueprint defining shared behavior for all robot types.

| Member Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `robotId` | Unique identifier for each robot. |
| `status` | Operational status (active, idle, maintenance). |

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `moveTo(location)` | Commands the robot to move to a specific warehouse location. |
| `selfCheck()` | Runs diagnostics to verify operational readiness. |

---

### Class: `AutonomousRobot`
A fully automated robot that navigates and picks items independently.

| Member Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `batteryLevel` | Current power level of the robot. |

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `navigateWarehouse()` | Calculates and follows the optimal route to pick items. |

---

### Class: `ManualRobot`
A robot that is human-operated with safety override controls.

| Member Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `operatorName` | Name of the assigned operator. |

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `overrideControls()` | Allows human control during special operations or malfunctions. |

---

## 3. Tracking and Priority Components

### Interface: `ITrackable`
Defines the standard behavior for objects that can be monitored or reported during operations.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `trackProgress(order)` | Tracks task execution for a given order. |
| `reportStatus()` | Returns the real-time status of a task or robot. |

---

### Class: `OrderPriorityComparator`
A comparator used by the scheduler to determine order execution priority.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `compare(orderA, orderB)` | Compares two orders based on urgency or delivery deadlines. |

---

## 4. Order and Packing Classes

### Class: `Order`
Represents a customer order and its items.

| Member Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `orderId` | Unique identifier for the order. |
| `status` | Current order state (pending, picking, packed, shipped). |
| `items` | List of items included in the order. |

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `updateStatus(new_status)` | Updates the orderâ€™s progress. |

---

### Class: `Item`
Represents a single inventory item to be picked.

| Member Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `itemId` | Unique item ID. |
| `name` | Name of the product. |
| `weight` | Weight of the item (for packaging optimization). |

---

### Class: `Package`
Represents a physical container for packed items.

| Member Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `packageId` | Unique identifier for the package. |
| `contents` | List of items contained within. |

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `seal()` | Finalizes and locks the package before shipment. |

---

### Class: `PackingStation`
Represents an operational area where packing tasks are performed.

| Member Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `stationId` | Unique identifier for the packing station. |
| `status` | Current operational state (available, busy, maintenance). |

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `packItem(item)` | Packs an individual picked item. |
| `sealPackage(package)` | Seals a completed package for shipping. |

## 5. Relationships Overview
- **OrchestrationEngine â†’ TaskScheduler** â†’ Schedules and assigns order tasks.  
- **OrchestrationEngine â†’ AbstractRobot** â†’ Allocates and monitors robot execution.  
- **OrchestrationEngine â†’ PackingStation** â†’ Assigns packing tasks post-pick completion.  
- **OrchestrationEngine â†’ Logger** â†’ Logs all operational events.  
- **TaskScheduler â†’ OrderPriorityComparator** â†’ Uses for order prioritization.  
- **Order** *contains* **Item(s)** â†’ Items are grouped under each order.  
- **Package** *includes* **Item(s)** â†’ Packed items ready for shipment.  
- **PackingStation** *creates* **Package(s)** â†’ Completes physical packing.  

---

## 6. Design Highlights
- **Abstract Inheritance:** `AutonomousRobot` and `ManualRobot` extend `AbstractRobot`.  
- **Interface Implementation:** `OrchestrationEngine` implements `ITrackable` for real-time monitoring.  
- **Composition:** The engine depends on `TaskScheduler`, `Logger`, and `PackingStation`.  
- **Comparator Integration:** `OrderPriorityComparator` enforces prioritization logic in scheduling.  

---

## 7. Future Extension Ideas
- Add **Battery-Aware Task Allocation** in `allocateRobot()` for power efficiency.  
- Introduce **Dynamic Rebalancing** â€” reassign active pickers/robots mid-operation.  
- Implement **AI-based Learning Scheduler** using analytics feedback loops.  
- Add **Visual Dashboard Hooks** for live warehouse monitoring.
