# Aerial Drone(UAV) Inventory Auditing System

The UAV Auditing System is designed to manage a fleet of autonomous UAVs for the purpose of performing rapid, safe, and highly accurate inventory audits in large-scale warehouse environments. The primary challenge this system addresses is the traditionally time-consuming, error-prone, and often hazardous task of manual cycle counts, particularly for inventory stored in high or hard-to-reach racking. Human workers must typically climb ladders, use forklifts, or rely on spot-checking, all of which can increase operational risk and reduce efficiency. By introducing autonomous aerial operations, the system reduces labor requirements, increases worker safety, removes the need for direct physical access to high storage, and ensures greater consistency and accuracy in data collection.

At its core, the UAV Auditing System receives audit tasks from the Inventory Management Service, such as “verify all inventory in aisle 7.” Once a request is received, the system creates an Audit Mission, which in turn assigns a suitable UAV from the fleet based on availability, battery level, and operational readiness. The Audit Mission then generates an optimal Flight Path using a path-planning algorithm that considers efficiency, collision avoidance, and coverage requirements. This Flight Path subsequently guides the UAV to navigate systematically through the designated aisle or section of the warehouse.

While the base `AuditMission` remains the most versatile class used for the majority of general and specific everyday audit tasks, it also serves as a parent class for specialized missions. These subclasses inherit all the core functionality of an `AuditMission` but override key methods to execute their unique logic:

* **FullCycleCountMission**: This mission overrides the standard `generate_flight_path()` method to implement a more exhaustive algorithm that ensures every single bin in its assigned `area_to_audit` is scanned.
* **AisleIntegrityMission**: This mission uses a different analysis process. It overrides the `analyze_results()` method to check for physical anomalies (like blockages or spills) instead of inventory data, storing its findings in its own `anomaly_report`.
* **LostItemSearchMission**: This mission is initiated with a specific `target_item_id`. It overrides `generate_flight_path()` to create a specialized search pattern (e.g., an expanding spiral) around the item's last known location.

`UAV` as an abstract class. This base class establishes the core functionalities common to all drones, such as `fly_path()` and `return_to_base()`, while leaving mission-critical methods like `scan_location()` to be implemented by specialized subclasses. This approach allows the fleet to consist of several distinct types of drones, each tailored for specific operational scenarios:

* **QuadcopterScanner**: A standard, agile drone used for the majority of audit tasks in open, easily accessible warehouse aisles.
* **LongRangeScannerDrone**: A specialized unit equipped with high-precision optical sensors, designed to scan inventory on high racking that is beyond the reach of standard drones.
* **NarrowAisleDrone**: A compact drone with advanced collision avoidance, built to navigate and scan in tightly packed aisles where maneuverability is critical.

To optimize mission assignments, the abstract `UAV` class also implements an `IComparable` interface. This requires each drone to have a `compareTo()` method, which allows the system to rank the entire fleet based on operational readiness. The primary sorting criterion is battery level, ensuring that the drone with the most charge is always prioritized for a new mission. This intelligent selection process enhances system efficiency and minimizes the risk of mission failure due to power loss. When an `AuditMission` is created, the `UAVAuditingSystem` sorts its available drones and assigns the most suitable UAV type from the top of the ranked list, ensuring the best tool is always used for the job.

During the mission, the UAV executes its fly_path() routine, autonomously traversing each waypoint defined in the Flight Path. At every location, the UAV uses its onboard cameras and scanners (barcode or RFID) to capture relevant data. This data typically includes high-resolution images of pallet or bin labels. The UAV then invokes its scan_location() method to process the captured images and generate Scan Results that summarize the detected barcodes or identifiers.

Once captured, the raw images and scan results are transmitted securely to the ImageProcessor, where they are analyzed using computer vision techniques. The ImageProcessor detects and reads barcodes or RFID tags, and then packages the interpreted data for further evaluation. Within the context of the Audit Mission, the embedded DiscrepancyDetector compares the scanned data with the expected inventory records from the Inventory Management Service. Any mismatches are automatically flagged as discrepancies and included in a detailed audit report, which is then returned to the Inventory Management Service for human review and potential corrective actions.
In parallel, the UAV Health Monitor continuously checks the UAV’s battery level, evaluates the status of sensors and motors, and logs routine maintenance schedules. This ensures that only UAVs deemed healthy are dispatched for missions, thereby reducing the likelihood of operational failures. If at any point a UAV’s battery falls below a safe threshold, the system can autonomously trigger the UAV to return_to_base() for recharging or servicing.
By integrating these capabilities, the UAV Auditing System coordinates the complete lifecycle of every Audit Mission—from initial task creation, through autonomous flight and data capture, to final analysis and discrepancy reporting. The result is a cohesive, object-oriented architecture that not only optimizes warehouse auditing processes but also maintains high reliability, operational resilience, and safety standards. This combination of autonomy, intelligence, and continuous monitoring ultimately empowers organizations to achieve faster, safer, and more accurate inventory management at scale.

Explaining multiplicity, inheritance, association and the relations : 
UAVHealthmonitor and ImageProcessor have a compositions 1-1 relation to the auditing system because they exist only as one object and behave as tools the auditmission class uses. As they do not serve any purpose on their own they have the composition relation.
Auditmission : Many audit missions managed by the auditing system. Composition relation because it doesnt serve any purpose without the auditing system.
UAV: Many UAVs can be deployed for an audit mission. UAV can exist without auditmission, hence the aggregator relation. 
Discrepancy detector: Only one per audit mission as it functions as a tool. Each mission gets its own(not an auditsystem tool) as it has to store that missions discrepancy data. Composition relation as it serves no purpose if not a part of auditmission.
Flightpath: each mission can have multiple flightpaths. Composition relation as it serves no purpose if not a part of auditmission.
