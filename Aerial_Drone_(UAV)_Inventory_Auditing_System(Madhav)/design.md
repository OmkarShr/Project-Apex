| `create_audit_mission(area_to_audit)` | Creates a new audit mission. |
| `dispatch_uav(mission_id)` | Dispatches a UAV for an audit mission. |
| `process_scan_data(mission_id, data)` | Processes the data scanned by a UAV. |
| `get_discrepancies(mission_id)` | Retrieves the discrepancies found in an audit mission. |

### Class: `UAV` (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)

Represents an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (drone).

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(uav_id, model, status, battery_level)` | Initializes a new UAV object. |
| `fly_path(path)` | Flies the UAV along a specified path. |
| `scan_location(location)` | Scans a location for inventory data. |
| `return_to_base()` | Returns the UAV to its base. |

### Class: `AuditMission`

Represents an inventory audit mission for a UAV.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(mission_id, area_to_audit, status)` | Initializes a new AuditMission object. |
| `assign_uav(uav_id)` | Assigns a UAV to the mission. |
| `generate_flight_path()` | Generates a flight path for the mission. |

### Class: `FlightPlanner`

A class for planning the flight path of a UAV.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `plan_path(start_location, locations_to_visit)` | Plans a flight path for a UAV. |

### Class: `FlightPath`

Represents the flight path of a UAV.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(waypoints)` | Initializes a new FlightPath object. |
| `get_next_waypoint()` | Gets the next waypoint in the flight path. |

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `detect_barcodes(image)` | Detects barcodes in an image. |

### Class: `BarcodeReader`

A class for reading barcodes from images.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `read_barcode(image)` | Reads a barcode from an image. |

### Class: `DiscrepancyDetector`

A class for detecting discrepancies between scanned data and inventory records.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `compare_with_inventory(scanned_data, inventory_data)` | Compares scanned data with inventory data to find discrepancies. |

### Class: `UAVHealthMonitor`

A class for monitoring the health of the UAVs.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `check_battery_level(uav_id)` | Checks the battery level of a UAV. |
| `check_for_errors(uav_id)` | Checks for any errors reported by a UAV. |
