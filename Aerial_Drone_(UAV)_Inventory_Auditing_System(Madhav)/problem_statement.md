### 13. Aerial Drone (UAV) Inventory Auditing System
Design a specialized system to manage a fleet of autonomous aerial drones (UAVs) for the purpose of rapid and accurate inventory auditing. The primary problem this module solves is the time-consuming and often hazardous task of manual cycle counting, especially for items stored in high, hard-to-reach racking. The system will be responsible for the entire lifecycle of an audit mission, including flight planning, autonomous navigation, data capture, and analysis.[10] It will receive audit tasks, such as "verify all inventory in aisle 7," from the Inventory Management Service. The system will then generate an optimal flight path for a drone to systematically fly through the aisle. During flight, the drone will use its onboard cameras and scanners (e.g., barcode or RFID readers) to capture data from each pallet or bin label. This captured data will be processed, potentially using computer vision to read barcodes, and then transmitted back to the Inventory Management Service to be compared against the system's records, automatically flagging any discrepancies for human review. The module must also manage the drone fleet's health, including battery life and maintenance schedules.[10]
