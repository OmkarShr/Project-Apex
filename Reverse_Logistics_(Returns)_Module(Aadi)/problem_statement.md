### 8. Reverse Logistics (Returns) Module
Design a comprehensive module to manage the entire returns process, also known as reverse logistics, which is a critical component of customer satisfaction and inventory control in e-commerce. The module's workflow begins when a customer initiates a return, handling the creation of a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) and providing the customer with a shipping label and clear instructions. Upon arrival of the returned item at the warehouse, this module orchestrates the receiving and inspection process. It guides operators to assess the item's condition, verifying if it is unopened, damaged, or used. Based on this inspection, the module applies business rules to determine the next step: restocking the item into sellable inventory, routing it for refurbishment, or flagging it for disposal. A key integration point is with the Inventory Management Service, which it instructs to update stock levels accordingly. It also communicates with the Billing and Payment Subsystem to trigger the customer's refund or store credit, ensuring a seamless and transparent experience for the customer while maintaining accurate financial and inventory records for the business.
