### 14. Fleet & Vehicle Management Service
Design a comprehensive service to manage the entire lifecycle and operational status of the company's physical delivery fleet. This module acts as the central repository for all vehicle and driver information, serving as the foundation for the last-mile delivery operations. Its core responsibility is to maintain a detailed registry of all delivery vehicles, tracking key attributes such as vehicle ID, license plate, make, model, cargo capacity (weight and volume), and current status (e.g., `At Warehouse`, `On Route`, `Under Maintenance`). The service must also manage driver profiles, linking them to assigned vehicles and tracking their shift schedules and availability. A critical function is to oversee vehicle health and compliance, scheduling and logging routine maintenance, inspections, and insurance renewals to ensure the fleet remains safe and operational. This module will provide essential data to the Route Planning engine about vehicle capacity and availability, and it will receive real-time location updates from the Delivery Tracking module to maintain an accurate, live picture of the entire fleet's disposition at any given moment.
