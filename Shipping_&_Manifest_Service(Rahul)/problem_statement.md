### 7. Shipping & Manifest Service
Design a service to manage all aspects of the outbound shipping process, acting as the critical link between a packed order and the logistics carriers that will deliver it. This module's core responsibility is to automate the complex tasks of carrier selection, rate calculation, and documentation generation. It must integrate with the APIs of multiple shipping carriers (e.g., UPS, FedEx, USPS) to fetch real-time shipping rates based on package weight, dimensions, destination, and desired service level.[7] The service will contain business logic to automatically select the most cost-effective or fastest carrier based on predefined rules or order-specific requirements. Once a carrier is selected, it must generate all necessary documentation, including compliant shipping labels with barcodes and tracking numbers, and compile end-of-day manifests required for carrier pickup. This module is triggered by the Picking & Packing Engine once an order is packed and ready. It then updates the Order Management Service with the tracking number and shipping details, which are ultimately relayed to the customer for real-time tracking of their delivery.[9, 8]
