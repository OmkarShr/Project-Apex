# Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) Control System Design (Revised)

## 1. Classes and Member Methods

### Class: `AMRControlSystem`

The main system for controlling the AMR fleet.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `dispatch_amr(task)` | Dispatches an AMR to perform a task. |
| `get_amr_status(amr_id)` | Retrieves the status of an AMR. |
| `plan_path(start, end)` | Plans a path for an AMR to follow. |
| `avoid_obstacle(amr_id, obstacle_location)` | Instructs an AMR to avoid an obstacle. |
| `send_amr_to_charge(amr_id)` | Sends an AMR to a charging station. |

### Class: `AMR` (Autonomous Mobile Robot)

Represents an Autonomous Mobile Robot.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(amr_id, model, status, battery_level, location)` | Initializes a new AMR object. |
| `move_to(destination)` | Moves the AMR to a specific destination. |
| `update_map(map_data)` | Updates the AMR's internal map. |
| `broadcast_location()` | Broadcasts the AMR's current location. |

### Class: `NavigationSystem`

A system for navigation and pathfinding.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `calculate_path(start, end, map)` | Calculates the optimal path from a start to an end point. |
| `update_map_with_slam(sensor_data)` | Updates the map using SLAM. |

### Class: `Path`

Represents a path for an AMR to follow.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(points)` | Initializes a new Path object. |
| `get_next_waypoint()` | Gets the next waypoint in the path. |

### Class: `Map`

Represents the map of the warehouse.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(map_data)` | Initializes a new Map object. |
| `get_obstacles()` | Gets the locations of all obstacles on the map. |
| `update_obstacle(location, type)` | Updates the map with a new obstacle. |

### Class: `ObstacleAvoidanceSystem`

A system for avoiding obstacles.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `detect_obstacle(sensor_data)` | Detects an obstacle from sensor data. |
| `reroute_around_obstacle(amr, obstacle)` | Reroutes an AMR around an obstacle. |

### Class: `HealthMonitor`

A system for monitoring the health of the AMRs.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `check_battery_level(amr)` | Checks the battery level of an AMR. |
| `check_for_errors(amr)` | Checks for any errors reported by an AMR. |

### Class: `ChargingStation`

Represents a charging station for AMRs.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(station_id, location, status)` | Initializes a new ChargingStation object. |
| `is_available()` | Checks if the charging station is available. |
