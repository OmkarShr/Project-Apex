### 10. Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) Control System
Design a specialized control system dedicated to managing the fleet of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), which are responsible for transporting goods throughout the warehouse. Unlike simpler AGVs that follow fixed paths, this system must support the advanced capabilities of AMRs that navigate dynamically using onboard sensors, cameras, and LiDAR.[10] The core of this module is a sophisticated navigation and pathfinding engine, likely implementing algorithms like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to allow robots to create and update internal maps of the facility in real-time. It must be capable of intelligent obstacle avoidance, enabling AMRs to dynamically reroute around temporary obstructions like a misplaced pallet or a human worker, rather than stopping and waiting.[10] The system will expose a high-level API to the Master Robotics Control dispatcher, accepting commands like "move from point A to point B." It will also be responsible for managing the fleet's health, including monitoring battery levels and automatically dispatching robots to charging stations when needed to ensure continuous, uninterrupted operation of the transport layer.[11]
