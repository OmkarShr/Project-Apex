### 2. Product Catalog Service
The **Product Catalog Service** *is designed* as a highly available, centralized, and authoritative **repository** that *acts* as the definitive "single source of truth" for all **product master data** across the entire **warehouse** and **logistics ecosystem**. This centralization *is* critical because nearly every other operational **module**—from inbound **logistics** that *verifies* **shipments** to the **picking engine** that *plans* robotic **grasping**—*depends* heavily on the accuracy, completeness, and currency of the **product data** *maintained* within this **service**. The core **responsibility** of the **service** *is to manage* the full **lifecycle** of **product information**, *covering* unique **Stock Keeping Units (SKUs)**, detailed **product descriptions**, high-resolution **images**, and most importantly, precise **physical attributes** such as **product dimensions** and **weight**.

Beyond basic **product details**, the **service** *must capture* and *serve* complex, business-critical **metadata** like special **handling requirements**—fragility or temperature-controlled **shipping**, for instance—along with detailed **storage constraints** such as **stackability limits**. **Customs information** for international **shipments**, including **country of origin** and **tariff codes**, *is also managed* here to *ensure* seamless **logistics operations** and **compliance** with global **trade regulations**. This rich **information** *allows* downstream **modules** to *perform* their **functions** accurately, *eliminating* cascading **errors** like incorrect **shipping charges**, inefficient **slotting**, or failed automated **handling**.

The **architecture** *leverages* an object-oriented **design** where the **service** *models* **catalog entities** through **classes** such as **ProductCatalogService**, **Product**, and **SKU**. Each actual **product** in the **catalog** *is represented* as an **object composed** of multiple **attributes**, some of which *are* complex and business critical. The **system** *makes* extensive use of **inheritance**: the base **class ProductAttribute** *is extended* by specialized **subclasses** like **Dimension**, **Weight**, **HandlingRequirement**, **StorageConstraint**, and **CustomsInfo**. This **inheritance hierarchy** *facilitates* **extensibility** and **maintainability**, *allowing* the addition of new **product attributes** or specialized **data types** without *impacting* existing **functionality**.

The **service** *exposes* a robust and high-performance **API** *designed* for low-latency **queries** and **retrievals**, *ensuring* seamless **interoperability** with other **modules**. Whether the **picking engine** *needs* to quickly *gather* **item dimensions** for robotic **grasp planning** or inbound **logistics** *needs* to *validate* a **shipment’s contents** against expected **SKUs**, the **product catalog service** *responds* efficiently and reliably. To *guarantee* **data consistency** and *eliminate* **redundancy**, the **service** *enforces* centralized **updates** and **lifecycle management**, *preventing* the proliferation of stale or inconsistent **data** across **systems**.

To *support* high **availability**, the **service** *is architected* with **fault tolerance** and **horizontal scalability** in mind. It *employs* **caching mechanisms** to *speed up* frequently accessed **data** and *integrates* with distributed **storage solutions** for *handling* large **volumes** of high-resolution **product images**. Each **SKU’s data** *is carefully validated* upon **creation** and **updates**, *ensuring* the **integrity** of the master **data**. **Mechanisms** such as **versioning** and **audit trails** *may also be employed* for **traceability** and **rollback capabilities**.

Together, this **design** *underpins* the accuracy and efficiency of the entire **warehouse** and **logistics operation**, *enabling* smarter **slotting**, precise **shipping calculations**, and optimized **handling** by **robots**, thereby *reducing* **costs** and *elevating* **service quality** across the **supply chain**. This **foundation** *empowers* real-time **decision-making**, *improves* **supply chain resilience**, *enhances* **customer satisfaction** through reliable **deliveries**, and *drives* continuous **operational improvements**, *ensuring* the **service** *remains adaptable* to future **business needs**.
