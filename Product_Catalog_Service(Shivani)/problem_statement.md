### 2. Product Catalog Service
Design and specify a highly available, centralized service to act as the definitive "single source of truth" for all product master data. This service is foundational to the entire warehouse and logistics operation, as nearly every other module relies on its data for accurate functioning. The core task is to manage the complete lifecycle of product information, including unique Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), detailed descriptions, high-resolution images, and, critically, precise physical attributes like dimensions and weight.[3] Furthermore, it must capture and serve complex, business-critical data such as special handling requirements (e.g., fragility, temperature control), storage constraints (e.g., stackability limits), and customs information for international shipping. The service must provide a robust, high-performance API that allows other modules—from Inbound Logistics verifying a shipment to the Picking Engine planning a robot's grasp—to query and retrieve this data with minimal latency. By ensuring data consistency and eliminating redundancy, this module prevents cascading errors, such as incorrect shipping charges, inefficient storage allocation (slotting), or failed robotic handling, thereby underpinning the accuracy and efficiency of the entire ecosystem.[2]
