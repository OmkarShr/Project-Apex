### 4. Inventory Management & Location Service
Design the core service that functions as the real-time "digital twin" of the physical warehouse, maintaining a perpetually accurate and consistent record of every single inventory item's quantity, status, and precise location. This module is the central nervous system for all stock-related operations. It must digitally model the entire warehouse layout, from broad zones down to individual bins, and manage all inventory transactions with absolute transactional integrity.[4, 1] This includes adding stock upon receipt, decrementing stock upon shipment, and handling complex internal movements like transfers between bulk storage and forward picking areas. A key feature is the implementation of dynamic slotting algorithms, which analyze product velocity, dimensions, and sales data to strategically place items in optimal locations, minimizing travel time for both robots and human pickers.[2, 5] The service must also manage a nuanced inventory status system (e.g., Available, Reserved, Quality Hold, Damaged) to provide a complete picture of stock health. It will be the authoritative source for all stock queries, from the Order Management Service checking availability to the Robotics Controller requesting an item's exact coordinates for a pick task.[1, 6]
