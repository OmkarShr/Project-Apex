### 17. Customer Notification & Proof of Delivery Service
Design a dedicated service to manage all automated communications with the customer during the delivery phase and to securely capture proof of delivery. This module's primary goal is to create a transparent and trustworthy delivery experience, reducing customer anxiety and lowering the volume of support inquiries.[12, 14] It will subscribe to events from the Order Management and Delivery Tracking services to trigger proactive notifications to customers via SMS or email at key stages of the process, such as "Your order is out for delivery" and "Your driver is 10 minutes away." A key feature is providing customers with a link to a live tracking page showing their package's real-time location and an accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).[7] Upon arrival, the module facilitates the capture of Proof of Delivery (POD) through the driver's mobile app. This can include collecting a digital signature, taking a photo of the package at the doorstep for contactless delivery, or scanning a barcode. This captured POD is then securely stored and linked to the order record, serving as indisputable evidence of a successful delivery.[12]
