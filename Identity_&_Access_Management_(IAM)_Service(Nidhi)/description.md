# Identity & Access Management (IAM) Service — Project Apex

The IAM Service is designed to provide a centralized, secure, and robust identity and access management solution for the **Project Apex** ecosystem. As modern warehousing and logistics systems integrate robotics, IoT devices, and advanced analytics, maintaining security and proper access control across all components becomes critical.

## Problem Statement

Modern warehousing and delivery logistics are undergoing a rapid transformation, driven by the integration of robotics, IoT devices, and advanced data analytics.  

As **Project Apex** seeks to establish a comprehensive, end-to-end software ecosystem to automate and optimize every stage of warehouse and logistics operations, a critical challenge arises: the need for a centralized, robust, and secure identity and access management service.

This service must manage, authenticate, and authorize a wide variety of actors, ranging from human operators to autonomous systems, while strictly enforcing security and compliance requirements.

---

## Context

The ecosystem of Project Apex encompasses diverse stakeholders.

**Human roles:** Warehouse managers, administrators, pickers, and drivers — each requiring specific access to different systems and data.  

**Autonomous systems:** Robots and distributed services that require authenticated communication and secure interactions with other modules.

Without a unified and well-structured identity management service, inconsistencies and vulnerabilities could emerge, compromising operational integrity and exposing sensitive information.

---

## Proposed Solution

To address these challenges, the proposed service must implement a sophisticated **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** model.

This model ensures every user, whether human or machine, possesses precisely the permissions required to perform their assigned tasks — no more and no less.  

By enforcing the **principle of least privilege**, the system will prevent unauthorized actions, such as a picker accessing managerial analytics or a driver modifying inventory records.

## Key Features

- **Full account lifecycle**: creation, onboarding, maintenance, and deactivation  
- **Token-based authentication**: secure, scalable credentials using JWTs  
- **Authorization API**: low-latency checks for permissions before sensitive operations  
- **Audit logging**: track and review all access decisions and changes  
- **Compliance enforcement**: ensure least privilege and security best practices across modules

---

## Summary

By providing, enforcing, and monitoring secure role-based access control, the IAM service will not only reduce the risk of unauthorized activities but also enable seamless collaboration between human operators and autonomous systems.

Its robust, scalable, and resilient architecture will ensure that the smart warehouse ecosystem remains secure, compliant, and efficient as it continues to evolve and scale.
