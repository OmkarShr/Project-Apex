### 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM) Service
Design a centralized, robust, and secure service to manage the identities and access privileges for all actors within the smart warehouse ecosystem. This includes human operators with diverse roles—such as warehouse managers, pickers, drivers, and administrators—as well as autonomous system services and robots that require authenticated communication. The service must implement a sophisticated Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, ensuring that each user or system has precisely the permissions required for their tasks, and no more.[1] It needs to handle the complete lifecycle of user accounts, from creation to deactivation, and provide a secure authentication mechanism, likely using industry-standard tokens (e.g., JWT) suitable for a distributed, service-oriented architecture.[2] A critical function will be to expose a high-availability, low-latency authorization API that other modules can query in real-time to verify permissions before executing sensitive operations, such as modifying inventory levels, dispatching a delivery fleet, or accessing financial reports. The design must be granular enough to enforce policies like preventing a picker from viewing management analytics or a driver from altering inventory records, thereby safeguarding data integrity and operational security across the entire platform.
