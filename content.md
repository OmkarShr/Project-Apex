## Module Sub-Problem Statements

### 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM) Service(Nidhi)
Design a centralized, robust, and secure service to manage the identities and access privileges for all actors within the smart warehouse ecosystem. This includes human operators with diverse roles—such as warehouse managers, pickers, drivers, and administrators—as well as autonomous system services and robots that require authenticated communication. The service must implement a sophisticated Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, ensuring that each user or system has precisely the permissions required for their tasks, and no more.[1] It needs to handle the complete lifecycle of user accounts, from creation to deactivation, and provide a secure authentication mechanism, likely using industry-standard tokens (e.g., JWT) suitable for a distributed, service-oriented architecture.[2] A critical function will be to expose a high-availability, low-latency authorization API that other modules can query in real-time to verify permissions before executing sensitive operations, such as modifying inventory levels, dispatching a delivery fleet, or accessing financial reports. The design must be granular enough to enforce policies like preventing a picker from viewing management analytics or a driver from altering inventory records, thereby safeguarding data integrity and operational security across the entire platform.

### 2. Product Catalog Service(Shivani)
Design and specify a highly available, centralized service to act as the definitive "single source of truth" for all product master data. This service is foundational to the entire warehouse and logistics operation, as nearly every other module relies on its data for accurate functioning. The core task is to manage the complete lifecycle of product information, including unique Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), detailed descriptions, high-resolution images, and, critically, precise physical attributes like dimensions and weight.[3] Furthermore, it must capture and serve complex, business-critical data such as special handling requirements (e.g., fragility, temperature control), storage constraints (e.g., stackability limits), and customs information for international shipping. The service must provide a robust, high-performance API that allows other modules—from Inbound Logistics verifying a shipment to the Picking Engine planning a robot's grasp—to query and retrieve this data with minimal latency. By ensuring data consistency and eliminating redundancy, this module prevents cascading errors, such as incorrect shipping charges, inefficient storage allocation (slotting), or failed robotic handling, thereby underpinning the accuracy and efficiency of the entire ecosystem.[2]

### 3. Inbound Logistics & Receiving Module(Riddhimman)
Design a comprehensive module to manage and orchestrate the entire lifecycle of inbound goods, from supplier notification to final putaway. This module serves as the primary gateway for all physical inventory entering the warehouse. Its responsibilities begin with the digital processing of Advance Shipping Notices (ASNs) from suppliers, which provides critical foresight into incoming stock. It must then manage a sophisticated dock scheduling system to coordinate truck arrivals, preventing congestion and ensuring that labor and equipment are allocated efficiently. During the physical receiving process, the module will provide a guided workflow for operators—likely via handheld devices—to verify incoming products against purchase orders, accurately record quantities, and systematically identify and document any discrepancies or damages.[2] A key function is to initiate quality control workflows, automatically flagging items that require inspection and routing them to the appropriate warehouse zone. Upon successful verification, this module's final and most critical task is to communicate authoritatively with the Inventory Management Service, triggering the creation of new, accurate inventory records that make the received goods officially available for sale and fulfillment within the system.

### 4. Inventory Management & Location Service(Joshua)
Design the core service that functions as the real-time "digital twin" of the physical warehouse, maintaining a perpetually accurate and consistent record of every single inventory item's quantity, status, and precise location. This module is the central nervous system for all stock-related operations. It must digitally model the entire warehouse layout, from broad zones down to individual bins, and manage all inventory transactions with absolute transactional integrity.[4, 1] This includes adding stock upon receipt, decrementing stock upon shipment, and handling complex internal movements like transfers between bulk storage and forward picking areas. A key feature is the implementation of dynamic slotting algorithms, which analyze product velocity, dimensions, and sales data to strategically place items in optimal locations, minimizing travel time for both robots and human pickers.[2, 5] The service must also manage a nuanced inventory status system (e.g., Available, Reserved, Quality Hold, Damaged) to provide a complete picture of stock health. It will be the authoritative source for all stock queries, from the Order Management Service checking availability to the Robotics Controller requesting an item's exact coordinates for a pick task.[1, 6]

### 5. Order Management Service(Omkar)
Design a central service to orchestrate the entire lifecycle of a customer order, from initial ingestion to final fulfillment confirmation. This module acts as the primary hub for all sales-related activities, responsible for receiving and validating orders from multiple channels, such as e-commerce websites, mobile apps, or enterprise ERP systems. Upon ingestion, it must perform a series of critical validations, including verifying customer details, checking for fraudulent activity, and, most importantly, communicating with the Inventory Management Service to confirm stock availability and place an atomic reservation on the required items to prevent overselling.[7] Once an order is confirmed and payment is authorized, this service becomes the master state machine, tracking the order's progress through subsequent stages: `Pending`, `Processing`, `Awaiting_Shipment`, `Shipped`, and `Delivered`. It is responsible for initiating downstream workflows by publishing events or sending commands to other modules, such as instructing the Picking & Packing Orchestration Engine to begin fulfillment and later notifying the Shipping & Manifest Service when a package is ready for dispatch. This module provides the unified, authoritative view of an order's status for both internal operators and the end customer.[8]

### 6. Picking & Packing Orchestration Engine(Kushi)
Design an intelligent engine responsible for translating confirmed customer orders into optimized, executable tasks for the warehouse floor. This module acts as the bridge between the digital order and the physical fulfillment process. Its primary function is to receive fulfillment requests from the Order Management Service and apply sophisticated logic to create the most efficient picking strategy. This involves implementing various algorithms, such as batch picking (grouping multiple orders with common items), zone picking (assigning pickers to specific areas), or wave picking (scheduling picks in timed waves) to minimize travel time and maximize throughput. The engine must be aware of the warehouse layout, real-time inventory locations (from Module 4), and the capabilities of available resources (both human operators and robots). It will generate and dispatch prioritized pick lists to workers' handheld devices or directly to the Master Robotics Control system. Concurrently, it will orchestrate the workflow at packing stations, providing packers with correct order details, specifying required packaging materials based on product data (from Module 2), and guiding them through the final verification and sealing process before the package is handed off for shipping.[3]

### 7. Shipping & Manifest Service(Rahul)
Design a service to manage all aspects of the outbound shipping process, acting as the critical link between a packed order and the logistics carriers that will deliver it. This module's core responsibility is to automate the complex tasks of carrier selection, rate calculation, and documentation generation. It must integrate with the APIs of multiple shipping carriers (e.g., UPS, FedEx, USPS) to fetch real-time shipping rates based on package weight, dimensions, destination, and desired service level.[7] The service will contain business logic to automatically select the most cost-effective or fastest carrier based on predefined rules or order-specific requirements. Once a carrier is selected, it must generate all necessary documentation, including compliant shipping labels with barcodes and tracking numbers, and compile end-of-day manifests required for carrier pickup. This module is triggered by the Picking & Packing Engine once an order is packed and ready. It then updates the Order Management Service with the tracking number and shipping details, which are ultimately relayed to the customer for real-time tracking of their delivery.[9, 8]

### 8. Reverse Logistics (Returns) Module(Aadi)
Design a comprehensive module to manage the entire returns process, also known as reverse logistics, which is a critical component of customer satisfaction and inventory control in e-commerce. The module's workflow begins when a customer initiates a return, handling the creation of a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) and providing the customer with a shipping label and clear instructions. Upon arrival of the returned item at the warehouse, this module orchestrates the receiving and inspection process. It guides operators to assess the item's condition, verifying if it is unopened, damaged, or used. Based on this inspection, the module applies business rules to determine the next step: restocking the item into sellable inventory, routing it for refurbishment, or flagging it for disposal. A key integration point is with the Inventory Management Service, which it instructs to update stock levels accordingly. It also communicates with the Billing and Payment Subsystem to trigger the customer's refund or store credit, ensuring a seamless and transparent experience for the customer while maintaining accurate financial and inventory records for the business.

### 9. Master Robotics Control & Task Dispatcher(Purva)
Design the central "brain" for the entire robotic fleet, acting as a master orchestration and dispatching service. This module abstracts the complexity of managing a heterogeneous collection of robots (AMRs, AS/RS, drones) by providing a single, unified interface for other systems to request automated tasks.[10, 11] Its primary responsibility is to receive high-level commands, such as "retrieve product SKU 123 from location A-14-2" from the Picking Engine or "audit aisle B" from the Inventory Service. It then translates these commands into specific instructions for the most suitable type of robot. The dispatcher must maintain a real-time registry of all available robots, tracking their current status (e.g., `Idle`, `Executing`, `Charging`), battery levels, and location within the warehouse. It will employ intelligent algorithms to prioritize tasks and assign them to the optimal robotic unit based on proximity, capability, and current workload, ensuring maximum utilization and efficiency of the automation hardware. This service is the critical command and control layer that decouples business logic from the low-level mechanics of robotic operation.[10, 4]

### 10. Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) Control System(Saransh)
Design a specialized control system dedicated to managing the fleet of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), which are responsible for transporting goods throughout the warehouse. Unlike simpler AGVs that follow fixed paths, this system must support the advanced capabilities of AMRs that navigate dynamically using onboard sensors, cameras, and LiDAR.[10] The core of this module is a sophisticated navigation and pathfinding engine, likely implementing algorithms like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to allow robots to create and update internal maps of the facility in real-time. It must be capable of intelligent obstacle avoidance, enabling AMRs to dynamically reroute around temporary obstructions like a misplaced pallet or a human worker, rather than stopping and waiting.[10] The system will expose a high-level API to the Master Robotics Control dispatcher, accepting commands like "move from point A to point B." It will also be responsible for managing the fleet's health, including monitoring battery levels and automatically dispatching robots to charging stations when needed to ensure continuous, uninterrupted operation of the transport layer.[11]

### 11. Automated Storage/Retrieval (AS/RS) Gateway(Arjun)
Design a standardized software gateway to control and integrate the Automated Storage and Retrieval System (AS/RS), which is typically used for high-density, automated storage of inventory. AS/RS hardware, such as cranes, shuttles, and vertical lift modules, often comes with proprietary control systems. The primary purpose of this module is to create a unified, hardware-agnostic API that abstracts away these vendor-specific complexities.[10] It will provide a simple, consistent set of commands (e.g., `storeItem(binId, location)`, `retrieveItem(binId)`) that the Master Robotics Control dispatcher can use without needing to understand the underlying mechanics of the AS/RS machinery. This gateway will be responsible for translating these high-level commands into the specific protocols required by the AS/RS hardware controller. It will also manage the state of the AS/RS, track the movement of its components, handle error conditions, and report task completion or failures back to the master dispatcher. By acting as a standardized intermediary, this module ensures that the AS/RS can be seamlessly integrated into the warehouse's overall automated workflow and can be upgraded or replaced in the future with minimal impact on the rest of the software ecosystem.[4, 1]

### 12. Customer Relations Module(Sameet)
Design a dedicated module to manage all non-transactional interactions with the customer, serving as the central hub for support, communication, and relationship management. This system's primary goal is to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty by providing a seamless and responsive service experience.[12, 13] It must provide a multi-channel support ticketing system, allowing customers to submit inquiries via email, a web portal, or chat. The module will track the entire lifecycle of a support ticket, from creation to resolution, ensuring timely responses and escalations. It will integrate deeply with the Order Management and Shipping services to provide support agents with a 360-degree view of a customer's order history, shipping status, and past interactions, enabling them to resolve issues efficiently. Furthermore, this module will manage a knowledge base or FAQ section to empower customers with self-service options. It will also be responsible for proactive communications, such as service announcements or personalized follow-ups, and will collect customer feedback through surveys to provide valuable insights to the business for continuous improvement.

### 13. Aerial Drone (UAV) Inventory Auditing System(Madhav)
Design a specialized system to manage a fleet of autonomous aerial drones (UAVs) for the purpose of rapid and accurate inventory auditing. The primary problem this module solves is the time-consuming and often hazardous task of manual cycle counting, especially for items stored in high, hard-to-reach racking. The system will be responsible for the entire lifecycle of an audit mission, including flight planning, autonomous navigation, data capture, and analysis.[10] It will receive audit tasks, such as "verify all inventory in aisle 7," from the Inventory Management Service. The system will then generate an optimal flight path for a drone to systematically fly through the aisle. During flight, the drone will use its onboard cameras and scanners (e.g., barcode or RFID readers) to capture data from each pallet or bin label. This captured data will be processed, potentially using computer vision to read barcodes, and then transmitted back to the Inventory Management Service to be compared against the system's records, automatically flagging any discrepancies for human review. The module must also manage the drone fleet's health, including battery life and maintenance schedules.[10]

### 14. Fleet & Vehicle Management Service(Aadi)
Design a comprehensive service to manage the entire lifecycle and operational status of the company's physical delivery fleet. This module acts as the central repository for all vehicle and driver information, serving as the foundation for the last-mile delivery operations. Its core responsibility is to maintain a detailed registry of all delivery vehicles, tracking key attributes such as vehicle ID, license plate, make, model, cargo capacity (weight and volume), and current status (e.g., `At Warehouse`, `On Route`, `Under Maintenance`).[12, 14] The service must also manage driver profiles, linking them to assigned vehicles and tracking their shift schedules and availability. A critical function is to oversee vehicle health and compliance, scheduling and logging routine maintenance, inspections, and insurance renewals to ensure the fleet remains safe and operational. This module will provide essential data to the Route Planning engine about vehicle capacity and availability, and it will receive real-time location updates from the Delivery Tracking module to maintain an accurate, live picture of the entire fleet's disposition at any given moment.

### 15. Route Planning & Optimization Engine(Megh)
Design a computationally intensive engine dedicated to solving the complex "traveling salesman" problem for the delivery fleet, calculating the most efficient multi-stop routes to minimize costs and meet customer expectations. This module is the strategic brain of the last-mile delivery operation.[15] It will ingest a batch of confirmed shipments from the Order Management Service, each with a specific delivery address and potentially a required delivery time window. The engine must then consider a multitude of real-time and static variables, including live traffic conditions, weather forecasts, vehicle capacities (from the Fleet Management Service), driver shift times, and order priorities. Using advanced algorithms and heuristics, it will calculate and generate optimized route plans for each driver, sequencing the stops to reduce total travel distance and time. The output will be a detailed, turn-by-turn itinerary for each vehicle, which is then passed to the Real-Time Delivery Tracking & Driver Interface module for execution. This engine is critical for reducing fuel consumption, increasing the number of deliveries a driver can make per shift, and ensuring on-time delivery promises are met.

### 16. Real-Time Delivery Tracking & Driver Interface(Swastik)
Design the backend service that powers the driver's mobile application and provides real-time visibility into the entire delivery process for both internal dispatchers and external customers. This module is the operational nexus of the last-mile. Its first key function is to serve the optimized route plans from the Route Planning Engine to the drivers' mobile devices, presenting them with a clear list of stops, navigation guidance, and specific delivery instructions for each order.[12, 14] As drivers proceed along their routes, the mobile app will continuously transmit GPS coordinates back to this service, allowing it to maintain a live, map-based view of the entire fleet's location. This real-time data feed is crucial for dispatchers to monitor progress and manage exceptions. The service will also process status updates sent from the driver's app, such as `Delivery_Completed` or `Delivery_Failed`, which in turn updates the Order Management Service. Finally, it exposes a secure API that allows the Customer Notification Service to provide customers with accurate, up-to-the-minute tracking information and ETAs for their packages.

### 17. Customer Notification & Proof of Delivery Service(John)
Design a dedicated service to manage all automated communications with the customer during the delivery phase and to securely capture proof of delivery. This module's primary goal is to create a transparent and trustworthy delivery experience, reducing customer anxiety and lowering the volume of support inquiries.[12, 14] It will subscribe to events from the Order Management and Delivery Tracking services to trigger proactive notifications to customers via SMS or email at key stages of the process, such as "Your order is out for delivery" and "Your driver is 10 minutes away." A key feature is providing customers with a link to a live tracking page showing their package's real-time location and an accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).[7] Upon arrival, the module facilitates the capture of Proof of Delivery (POD) through the driver's mobile app. This can include collecting a digital signature, taking a photo of the package at the doorstep for contactless delivery, or scanning a barcode. This captured POD is then securely stored and linked to the order record, serving as indisputable evidence of a successful delivery.[12]

### 18. Analytics & Reporting Dashboard(Prasham)
Design a comprehensive business intelligence module to aggregate, analyze, and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) from across the entire smart warehouse and delivery ecosystem. This service acts as the central nervous system for managerial oversight and strategic decision-making. It will ingest operational data and events from all other modules—such as order processing times, inventory accuracy rates, picking efficiency, robot utilization, on-time delivery percentages, and fuel costs.[16, 1] The module will process and store this data in a data warehouse or analytics database optimized for complex queries. Its primary output will be a series of user-friendly, real-time dashboards tailored to different roles, such as a warehouse manager's view focusing on operational throughput or a logistics manager's view focusing on delivery costs and performance. In addition to live dashboards, it will provide capabilities for generating historical reports, identifying long-term trends, and pinpointing bottlenecks or areas for improvement. This data-driven insight is essential for continuous optimization of the entire operation.[17, 2]

### 19. Predictive Intelligence Engine (AI/ML) (Tushar)
Design an advanced analytics module that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to move beyond historical reporting and provide predictive, forward-looking insights. This service aims to make the entire operation more proactive rather than reactive. One of its primary functions will be demand forecasting; by analyzing historical sales data, seasonality, and market trends, it will predict future product demand with a high degree of accuracy.[4, 6] These forecasts will be fed to the Inventory Management Service to optimize stock levels, preventing both stockouts and costly overstocking. Another critical function is predictive maintenance. By analyzing operational data from robots and delivery vehicles (e.g., runtime hours, sensor readings, error rates), the engine will build models to predict when a piece of equipment is likely to fail. This allows the system to automatically schedule maintenance before a breakdown occurs, minimizing unplanned downtime and ensuring the continuous, smooth operation of both the warehouse and the delivery fleet.[16, 2]

### 20. Billing and Payment Subsystem(Aditya Vilas)
Design a secure and reliable subsystem to manage all financial transactions related to customer orders. This module is responsible for the complete billing and payment lifecycle, ensuring accuracy and compliance. Its duties begin when an order is placed, where it must integrate with third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to securely authorize and capture payments from customers.[7] A core component of this module is a sophisticated pricing engine capable of calculating the final order total by applying various business rules, including item prices, volume-based discounts, promotional codes, and, critically, calculating applicable sales taxes based on the customer's shipping destination. Once an order is shipped, this module is responsible for finalizing the transaction and recording it in a secure financial ledger. It must also handle all financial aspects of returns, processing refunds or issuing store credit upon receiving instructions from the Reverse Logistics module. The subsystem must maintain a detailed, auditable history of all transactions and provide reporting capabilities for financial reconciliation and analysis.[15, 3]
