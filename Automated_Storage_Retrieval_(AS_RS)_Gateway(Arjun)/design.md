# Automated Storage/Retrieval (AS/RS) Gateway Design (Revised)

## 1. Classes and Member Methods

### Class: `ASRSGateway`

The gateway for interacting with the ASRS.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `send_command(command)` | Sends a command to the ASRS. |
| `get_response()` | Receives a response from the ASRS. |
| `get_status()` | Returns the status of the ASRS. |
| `set_adapter(adapter)` | Sets the adapter for the specific ASRS hardware. |

### Class: `ASRSCommand`

Represents a command to be sent to the ASRS.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(command_type, parameters)` | Initializes a new ASRSCommand object. |
| `to_json()` | Converts the command to a JSON string. |

### Class: `ASRSResponse`

Represents a response received from the ASRS.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `__init__(response_data)` | Initializes a new ASRSResponse object. |
| `is_successful()` | Checks if the command was successful. |
| `get_data()` | Gets the data from the response. |

### Class: `ASRSAdapter`

An abstract class for adapting to different ASRS hardware.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `translate_command(command)` | Translates a generic command to a hardware-specific command. |
| `translate_response(response)` | Translates a hardware-specific response to a generic response. |
| `send(data)` | Sends data to the ASRS hardware. |
| `receive()` | Receives data from the ASRS hardware. |

### Class: `CraneAdapter`

A concrete implementation for a crane-based ASRS.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `translate_command(command)` | Translates a command for a crane-based ASRS. |
| `translate_response(response)` | Translates a response from a crane-based ASRS. |

### Class: `ShuttleAdapter`

A concrete implementation for a shuttle-based ASRS.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `translate_command(command)` | Translates a command for a shuttle-based ASRS. |
| `translate_response(response)` | Translates a response from a shuttle-based ASRS. |

### Class: `VerticalLiftModuleAdapter`

A concrete implementation for a VLM-based ASRS.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `translate_command(command)` | Translates a command for a VLM-based ASRS. |
| `translate_response(response)` | Translates a response from a VLM-based ASRS. |

### Class: `ASRSErrorHandler`

A class for handling errors from the ASRS.

| Member Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `handle_error(error_code, error_message)` | Handles an error from the ASRS. |
