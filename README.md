# Project Apex - Smart Warehouse & Delivery Logistics System

## Overview

Project Apex is a comprehensive, end-to-end software ecosystem designed to automate and optimize warehouse operations and delivery logistics. The system leverages robotics, IoT, and data analytics to achieve maximum efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, from inventory receipt to final-mile customer delivery.

## System Architecture

The system is architected as 20 distinct yet integrated modules, each responsible for specific aspects of the warehouse and delivery operations:

### Core Modules

1. **Identity & Access Management (IAM) Service** - Centralized authentication and authorization
2. **Product Catalog Service** - Master data repository for all product information
3. **Inbound Logistics & Receiving Module** - Management of incoming inventory
4. **Inventory Management & Location Service** - Real-time inventory tracking and location management
5. **Order Management Service** - Complete order lifecycle management

### Fulfillment & Operations

6. **Picking & Packing Orchestration Engine** - Intelligent task optimization for warehouse floor
7. **Shipping & Manifest Service** - Carrier integration and shipping documentation
8. **Reverse Logistics (Returns) Module** - Returns processing and inventory management

### Automation & Robotics

9. **Master Robotics Control & Task Dispatcher** - Central orchestration for robotic fleet
10. **Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) Control System** - Dynamic navigation and transport
11. **Automated Storage/Retrieval (AS/RS) Gateway** - High-density storage automation
12. **Aerial Drone (UAV) Inventory Auditing System** - Automated inventory auditing

### Customer & Delivery

13. **Customer Relations Module** - Support and communication management
14. **Fleet & Vehicle Management Service** - Delivery fleet lifecycle management
15. **Route Planning & Optimization Engine** - Intelligent delivery route optimization
16. **Real-Time Delivery Tracking & Driver Interface** - Live tracking and driver coordination
17. **Customer Notification & Proof of Delivery Service** - Automated customer communications

### Analytics & Intelligence

18. **Analytics & Reporting Dashboard** - Business intelligence and KPI visualization
19. **Predictive Intelligence Engine (AI/ML)** - Machine learning for optimization and forecasting
20. **Billing and Payment Subsystem** - Financial transaction management

## Key Features

- **Robotics Integration**: Seamless coordination of AMRs, AS/RS systems, and aerial drones
- **Real-time Tracking**: Complete visibility from inventory receipt to customer delivery
- **Intelligent Optimization**: AI-driven route planning, picking strategies, and demand forecasting
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design supporting growth and technology evolution
- **Customer-Centric**: Automated notifications, real-time tracking, and seamless returns

## Technology Stack
