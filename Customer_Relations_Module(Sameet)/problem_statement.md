### 12. Customer Relations Module
Design a dedicated module to manage all non-transactional interactions with the customer, serving as the central hub for support, communication, and relationship management. This system's primary goal is to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty by providing a seamless and responsive service experience.[12, 13] It must provide a multi-channel support ticketing system, allowing customers to submit inquiries via email, a web portal, or chat. The module will track the entire lifecycle of a support ticket, from creation to resolution, ensuring timely responses and escalations. It will integrate deeply with the Order Management and Shipping services to provide support agents with a 360-degree view of a customer's order history, shipping status, and past interactions, enabling them to resolve issues efficiently. Furthermore, this module will manage a knowledge base or FAQ section to empower customers with self-service options. It will also be responsible for proactive communications, such as service announcements or personalized follow-ups, and will collect customer feedback through surveys to provide valuable insights to the business for continuous improvement.
