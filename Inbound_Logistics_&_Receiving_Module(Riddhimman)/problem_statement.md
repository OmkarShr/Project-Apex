### 3. Inbound Logistics & Receiving Module
Design a comprehensive module to manage and orchestrate the entire lifecycle of inbound goods, from supplier notification to final putaway. This module serves as the primary gateway for all physical inventory entering the warehouse. Its responsibilities begin with the digital processing of Advance Shipping Notices (ASNs) from suppliers, which provides critical foresight into incoming stock. It must then manage a sophisticated dock scheduling system to coordinate truck arrivals, preventing congestion and ensuring that labor and equipment are allocated efficiently. During the physical receiving process, the module will provide a guided workflow for operators—likely via handheld devices—to verify incoming products against purchase orders, accurately record quantities, and systematically identify and document any discrepancies or damages.[2] A key function is to initiate quality control workflows, automatically flagging items that require inspection and routing them to the appropriate warehouse zone. Upon successful verification, this module's final and most critical task is to communicate authoritatively with the Inventory Management Service, triggering the creation of new, accurate inventory records that make the received goods officially available for sale and fulfillment within the system.
